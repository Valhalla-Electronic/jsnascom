- save and restore state
- Do terminal input like jslinux (use a small auto selected field, but keystrokes
  are immediately reflected in the terminal).
- Use the serial port for pending_input
- DONE fix input handling to not assume a raw keyboard and
       thus allow input of all chars
- Maybe pause z80 while in the input field?
- DONE swap case on input field
- DONE write protect the basic ROM
- support loading nas files
- support loading and saving tapes
- snapshot state
- manage multiple snapshots
- button for external NMI
- DONE fix single stepping
- improve performance, especially on iPhone
  - DONE stop updating the whole screen all the time
  - use Typed arrays
  - use inlining memory accesses (hmm, protecting ROMs is tricky)
  - use periodic screen refresh instead of inline
  - exploit typed arrays to scan for changes four byte at a time
  - thrawl around for hints for JavaScript on iPhone
  - tune the T-state stuff.
  - recognize the idle loop and sleep instead of spinning
  - JIT it (great excuse for playing with TraceTree jitting)
- Reorganise and clean up the code
- figure out with port0 b2 and b5 does (goes to keyboard)
- add serial interface to files
- add support for importing sound files
- add touch support for arrow keys (configurable) so games are
  playable on the iPhone
